# How to contribute to the website?
1) Fork the repo ([how?](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))
2) Edit the files you want to be changed in your fork
3) Create a Pull Request into the repo with your fork ([how?](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork))
