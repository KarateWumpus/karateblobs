# Partners
Karate Blobs has a partner system that works like normal servers affiliate system. The ads don't just get posted and done. The server gets checked to see if it is a server that I would like to partner with, and if it is. I will ask you to post my ad and I will post yours. As of now there are no requirements in becoming partner, you simply just DM `Karate Wumpus#0001` saying you would like tp partner with Karate Blobs and we will work it out in DM's

For everyone wondering what the ad looks like. It is here:
```Want to try out some cool variants of the classic blobs? Then try
