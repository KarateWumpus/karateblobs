# Contribute with your own Karate Blob
Want to contribute to the huge amount of Karate Blobs in the [server](join-server.md), then check out this quick little guide that shows how to do so:
> If you don't know how to make blobs, but still have a suggestion, skip to step 3
---
#### 1. - Check if there already is a blob like that in the server
- Check if there is a blob like the one you want to make in the server by either [joining the server](join-server.md) and checking the emojis, or looking at the image below:
![Image](https://karate-blobs.glitch.me/images/all-blobs.gif)
> Note that the image may be outdated so checking in the server is the best

#### 2. - Make the blob
- Make the blob. To help a bit, the two templates I use are here:
- [For blobs facing forwards](http://karate-blobs.glitch.me/images/GI-F.png) | [For blobs facing to the side](http://karate-blobs.glitch.me/images/GI-S.png)

#### 3. - Suggest the blob
Go to the #bot-and-blob-spam channel in the server and use the command `.suggest <Suggestion>`.
- If you already have made a blob, use the command `.suggest Add my blob, <Description of the blob>` and ping Karate Wumpus#0001 (535803893419081779) in the channel with the image of the blob, then i will add it to the suggestion.
- If you havenâ€™t made a blob, but have a good idea for one. Use the command `.suggest Add a new blob, <Describe how you would like it to look here>`
If you have any questions, feel free to ask Karate Wumpus#0001 in the [server](join-server.md)
