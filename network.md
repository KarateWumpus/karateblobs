# Server network
Karate Blobs started a server network connected by the bot `Karate Boi#4933`. Servers in the network all share bans due to a command in the bot, allowing us to ban people from all servers it is a member in.
If you wish to become a part of the network, first thing you need to do is become a [partner](partner.md). Then I need to trust you, and then you need to ask me if your server can become a part of the network. More info will be available if you DM `Karate Wumpus#0001` on Discord ([Join the server](join-server.md))
