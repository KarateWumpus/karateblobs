# Server network
Karate Blobs started a server network connected by the bot `Karate Boi#4933`, one of the great features with that bot is that it has global ban command which allows us to ban troublemakers from all servers in the network.

If you wish to become a part of the network, first thing you need to do is become a [partner](partner.md). Then I need to trust you, and then you need to request to become a part of the network. More info will be available if you DM `Karate Wumpus#0001` on Discord ([Join the server](join-server.md))
