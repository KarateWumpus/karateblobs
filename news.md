# News

* Starting soon, this website will get an overhaul to make it look better.

---
* Karate Blobs is now blurple, we have 2 new cool blurple blobs, a blurple server icon and only blurple (Or close to blurple) roles. If you don't know what im talking about, check out [the Project Blurple server](https://discord.gg/blurple)

* The server hit 100 members. Maybe an event will happen, idk if I want to set one up yet. To find out more and be updated with the latest news, either [join the server](join-server.md) or [follow the announcement channel](follow.md)

* We now have everything moved to this new URL: https://karateblobs.js.org. This wouldn't have been possible without the [js.org](https://js.org) project. So a huge thanks to them.

* Everything is getting moved to a new URL, for more info please look at the announcement channel in the [server](join-server.md)
